    Sarah Minson wrote the original C version of CATMIP in 2010 as part of
    her Ph.D. thesis.

    In late 2011, Michael Aivazis rewrote CATMIP in python and C++, and
    refactored it into a collection of pyre components.

    altar was born in late 2012 as an attempt to reorganize the previous
    efforts into an extensible framework for exploring earthquake models
    using a broad spectrum of stochastic techniques.
